# Automated-AI-Video-Editing-Software-for-Hockey-Highlights
create automated AI software that edits video footage specifically focused on hockey goalie saves and goals against. The software should intelligently analyze the video to identify key moments and compile them into highlight reels. 
----------------
reating an AI-powered video editing system to analyze hockey footage and generate highlight reels requires a combination of video processing, machine learning, and computer vision. Below, I will outline an approach that uses Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV for video processing and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI.

The key steps to build such a system involve:

    Extracting frames from video.
    Detecting hockey plays (goals and saves) using AI models.
    Marking the highlights (goal saves and goals).
    Compiling the identified highlights into a highlight reel.

Since this is a complex problem, I will break it down and provide some basic code structure to get you started. However, a fully functional version of this system would require pre-trained deep learning models for action recognition (which might be trained on hockey video footage), or you might need to use a generic model (e.g., object detection, action recognition models like OpenPose or YOLO) trained on relevant data.

Below is a simplified version of the core elements of the project:
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV for video processing
    TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI modeling (for action recognition, goal/saves detection)
    MoviePy for video editing

Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python tensorflow moviepy numpy

# Example AI model loading for action recognition (using a pre-trained model, like MobileNet, EfficientNet, or your custom model)
def load_model():
    # This can be your custom model for detecting hockey plays or saves, trained on video clips
    model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)
    return model

def detect_action(frame, model):
    """Detect goal or save using AI model."""
    # Preprocess frame for the model
    resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))  # Adjust size based on model requirements
    image_array = np.expand_dims(resized_frame, axis=0) / 255.0  # Normalize input
    predictions = model.predict(image_array)
    
    # Assume the model is trained to classify goal/save actions
    predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions)
    if predicted_class == 0:  # For example: class 0 is 'save'
        return "save"
    elif predicted_class == 1:  # class 1 is 'goal'
        return "goal"
    return None

def extract_highlights(video_path, model):
    """Extract key moments (goal/save) from the video."""
    # Read video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    highlight_clips = []

    frame_count = 0
    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        frame_count += 1
        action = detect_action(frame, model)
        
        if action:  # If a key action (goal/save) is detected
            print(f"Action detected at frame {frame_count}: {action}")
            # Save the key frame or a portion of the video around the detected action
            start_time = (frame_count - 10) / fps  # Capture a 10-frame window before the action
            end_time = (frame_count + 10) / fps    # Capture a 10-frame window after the action
            
            highlight_clip = VideoFileClip(video_path).subclip(start_time, end_time)
            highlight_clips.append(highlight_clip)
        
    cap.release()
    return highlight_clips

def create_highlight_reel(highlight_clips):
    """Compile the identified highlights into a single video."""
    if highlight_clips:
        final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(highlight_clips)
        final_clip.write_videofile("hockey_highlights.mp4", codec="libx264", fps=30)
        print("Highlight reel created!")
    else:
        print("No highlights detected.")

    model = load_model()  # Load pre-trained AI model

    start_time = time.time()
    highlight_clips = extract_highlights(video_path, model)  # Extract key moments
    create_highlight_reel(highlight_clips)  # Create final highlight reel
    print(f"Process completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")

Key Concepts and Breakdown:

    detect_action(frame, model): This function uses a pre-trained AI model (such as MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, or a custom model) to predict actions in a given video frame. This could be a goal, a save, or other relevant hockey plays. In this example, we are assuming that we have a model trained to classify actions like "save" and "goal."

    extract_highlights(video_path, model): This function processes the video frame by frame, detects key actions (goal/save), and stores clips around those moments. A 10-frame window before and after the event is used to capture context for the highlight.

    create_highlight_reel(highlight_clips): After detecting and storing the key clips, this function concatenates them into a final highlight reel using MoviePy.

    AI Model for Action Detection: The action detection relies on a deep learning model (e.g., MobileNetV2 here) for classifying whether an action in a given frame is a "goal" or a "save." For better accuracy, you can train a custom model using labeled hockey video footage that includes goal/save events.

Example Workflow:

    Video Input: The script starts by reading a hockey game video file.
    AI Analysis: It processes the video frame by frame and applies a trained AI model to classify key moments.
    Highlight Extraction: When a goal or save is detected, the surrounding frames are extracted and stored as clips.
    Highlight Compilation: The clips are concatenated to create a highlight reel video.

Model Training:

To detect hockey-specific actions (e.g., saves and goals), you may need to:

    Collect a large dataset of labeled hockey videos with saves and goals.
    Train a custom model on action recognition or use object detection for puck tracking.
    Popular options include using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal action detection.

Limitations and Considerations:

    Model Accuracy: A general-purpose AI model like MobileNetV2 may not be sufficient for hockey-specific actions. You may need a model trained on hockey footage for better accuracy.
    Video Quality: Ensure that the input video is of high quality to detect important moments.
    Performance: Processing high-resolution videos frame-by-frame can be computationally expensive, so optimizations such as frame sampling or parallel processing may be necessary.

Future Work:

    Improved Action Detection: Instead of basic classification, you could explore more advanced techniques, such as tracking the puck or players using object detection models.
    Real-time Analysis: For real-time use, you can integrate this with live stream footage.

This is a starting point for the development of an AI-driven video editing tool specifically tailored to create highlight reels from hockey games.
